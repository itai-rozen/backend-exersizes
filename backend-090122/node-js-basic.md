things node.js has and javascript doesnt:
1. ability to run outside browsers. it is javascript runtime
but runs without relations to the browser.
2. non-blocking way of work. node.js can work asynchronously as opposed to javascript.
3. approach to the process object. thats an object javascript does not recogenize.

things javascript has and node.js doesnt: 
1. approach to the window object. javascript can manipulate browser's window (whatevet the user sees).
2. javascript is a programming language. node.js runs via javascript syntax and commands and does not
count as a language of its own.
3. single threaded. can only perform one task at a time.
